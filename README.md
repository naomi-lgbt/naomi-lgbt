Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile! Thank you for visiting! ðŸ™ƒ

<h2 align="center">About Me </h2>
<p align="center">
I am a software developer based in the United States. I primarily work in TypeScript, though I am willing to learn other languages if needed. For the front end, I use Angular. For the back end, I use Node.js with MongoDB and Express. Most of my projects tend to be Discord bots, powered by `discord.js`, as that is an area which I find engaging and challenging. And I am quite familiar with the Discord API. Aside from my dev work, I enjoy playing a game or reading a book. Though I spend most of my time working, either as a developer or as a community manager. I am quite passionate about community building, helping out in multiple communities while also maintaining my own. I can also be seen playing Dungeons and Dragons or Magic: The Gathering on occasion.

<h2 align="center">My Journey</h2>
<p align="center">
In April of 2020, I found myself in a position where I would resign from my retail work. In the midst of the pandemic, I was now unemployed - but in a good financial position where I could take some time off. My plan was originally to take a few months off to do nothing but lounge around, game, and explore my own interests. That... lasted all of two weeks before I was completely bored out of her mind. In need of a new hobby (and having always loved computers, electronics, and technology), I decided I would explore the idea of learning to code. I searched up "learn to code for free" and came across <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="blank">freeCodeCamp</a>, where I signed up and started the curriculum. While this was just intended to be a hobby, and I was considering a career in human resources, I ended up diving in full force. Within about 6 months I had completed the entire freeCodeCamp curriculum (at least, what was there at the time). Finding a strong love for this work, I continued to branch out. freeCodeCamp had taught me the basics of the MERN stack, but a fellow developer in the community had introduced me to TypeScript and Angular. I fell in love, and now use TypeScript on all of my projects. I became highly involved in open source, contributing to other projects and starting my own projects. Included in those contributions, of course, was the freeCodeCamp code base. After a few months of steady and quality contribution, she was given the chance to join the <a href="https://github.com/freecodecamp" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> team in December of 2020. I have remained there ever since, while also picking up work for <a href="https://github.com/streamcord" target="_blank">Streamcord</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rythm_community" target="_blank">Rythm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tweetshift" target="_blank">TweetShift</a>, and formerly <a href="https://github.com/semalab" target="_blank">Sema Software</a>.
