With a deep passion for leveraging technology for positive social impact, I am a community-oriented software engineer dedicated to cultivating safe, inclusive, and welcoming online spaces. My focus on user experience and accessibility drives me to create robust software tools and platforms that prioritize privacy, security, and diversity.

My career reflects a commitment to supporting aspiring developers as they break into the tech industry. Through mentorship, educational initiatives, and advocating for inclusive hiring practices, I strive to remove barriers and empower underrepresented individuals in the digital realm.

For me, software engineering goes beyond codingâ€”it's about using technology to drive positive change. By championing diversity, equity, and accessibility in every project, I aim to reshape the tech industry's narrative and contribute to a more equitable future.

Let's connect to drive meaningful impact and foster innovation and inclusivity in technology.
